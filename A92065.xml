            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is a Buſineſſe of great Conſequence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requires a wel-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Reſolution. I will put <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, take them both before mee, becauſe the Reaſons will ſerve one another, as they ſtand in Relation to us.</p>
            <p>Wee are, Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> ſo bounded by the nature of our Situation, as wee are not ſo proper to extend our ſelves upon the firme Land of our Neighbours; Our Apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is rather to Ballance, which being rightly uſed may make the King the great Arbiter of all the Affairs of Chriſtendome, by Aſſiſting, With-holding, or Oppoſing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henrie</hi> the Eighth is an Example of This; He was ſometimes of the ſide of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:157505:3"/>other times of the <hi>French</hi> Partie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as hee faw either ſide of the Scales to weigh heavier or lighter; Some might think this to be Inconſtancie in him, but it was certainly out of a true and peculiar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding his Power.</p>
            <p>The preſent State of Chriſtendome is apparant, That the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> begins to diminiſh, as in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo conſequently in <hi>Germanie.</hi> That the <hi>French</hi> doe ſwell and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large themſelves: if they Grow and Hold, They will be to us but <hi>Spaine</hi> neerer hand.</p>
            <p>Alliances do ſerve well To make up a preſent Breach, or mutually To ſtrengthen thoſe States who have the ſame Ends; but Politike Bodies have no Naturall Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are Guided by particular Intereſt, and beyond That are not to be truſted.</p>
            <p>Although it may be good Policy to breed a <hi>Militia</hi> at the charg of other States abroad for our own uſe and occaſions at home, yet That ought rather to bee done amongſt Friends of the ſame way, and ſo the <hi>Low Countries</hi> have been an <hi>Academie</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>His Majeſtie hath now an Embaſſador
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:157505:3"/>treating with the Emperour about the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate,</hi> If we ſend away our Men, it will ſo damp and diſcountenance the Affaires of the Prince Elector, as the World will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, we never had, nor ever ſhall have any Intentions, to Aſſiſt him at all.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved for divers yeers, That <hi>England</hi> is not ſo well Peopled, but wee do want Work-folks to bring in Harveſt, Our disbanded Souldiers will leaſt diſlike that kinde of work, and if they be ſpeedily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, That Employment will entertain them for the preſent, and inure them to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for hereafter.</p>
            <p>Vpon theſe Conſiderations, <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> I cannot give my advice to adde more ſtrength to <hi>France,</hi> by weakning both our ſelves and our Friends.</p>
            <p>As for ſending the <hi>Iriſh</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> Truly, Sir, I have beene long of Opinion, That it was never fit to ſuffer the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly made Souldiers abroad, becauſe it may make Them abler to trouble the State when they come home. Their Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and practice with the Princes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:157505:4"/>whom they ſhall ſerve, may prove dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to that Kingdome; They may more profitably be employed upon Husbandry, whereof that Countrey hath great need.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it will be exceeding prejudiciall to us, and to our Religion, If the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhould prevail againſt the <hi>Portuguez.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were better for us Hee ſhould be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into leſſer pieces, his Power ſhivered.</p>
            <p>If the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> had deſired theſe <hi>Iriſh,</hi> I ſhould rather have given my vote for Him, then for the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would keepe the Ballance more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; <hi>Spain</hi> hath had too much of our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and connivence heretofore; I am ſure it loſt us the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> Now that it is come to our Turne to adviſe, I hope wee ſhall not Do-over other mens faults again.</p>
            <p>If the preſent Government of <hi>Ireland</hi> be not able to reſtrain their diſordered People, there is a Noble Lord already deſigned to that Charge, who by his knowledge in Martiall Affaires, and other his great Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, will be, no doubt, abundantly capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to reduce them to a due obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:157505:4"/>
Wherefore, <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> upon the whole Matter, My Opinion is, That wee ſhould not be forward to ſpend our Men, but rather to Preſerve and husband them for our own uſe and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for our Friends, for our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
